# Balsn CTF 2022

I played with [Social Engineering Experts](https://ctftime.org/team/151372) and we finished in 8th place.

I only attempted the crypto challenges, but as it turns out, we were the only team to solve all four crypto challenges!

So here are the write-ups:
- [Yet another RSA with hint](RSA_hint.ipynb) (crypto, 38 solves)
- [vss](vss.ipynb) (crypto, 9 solves)
- [LFSR](LFSR.ipynb) (crypto, 6 solves)
- [Old but gold](old_but_gold.ipynb) (crypto, 4 solves)
