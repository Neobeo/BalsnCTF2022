    "# Old but gold\n",
    "\n",
    "I though this was more a reverse engineering challenge than a crypto one. In any case, the first step was to try to understand what the binary was doing at all. I am not familiar with go, but had good success using [AlphaGolang](https://github.com/SentineLabs/AlphaGolang) with IDA Pro to reasonably figure out what the code does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly speaking, it starts a web server which decrypts a token using [AES-CFB-128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_feedback_(CFB)) and parses it using `json.Unmarshal`. The token we are given corresponds to `{\"id\":\"3e2bf849-9748-4046-b5c7-626e0c25846c\",\"mail\":\"balsn7122@balsn.tw\"}` (up to json equivalence) while the token we want to give to obtain the flag is `{\"id\":\"aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-ffffffffffff\",\"mail\":\"admin\",\"type\":\"admin\"}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say up to json equivalence, because they could have provided `id` and `mail` in a different order, or have extra whitespace, or extraneous fields etc. Fortunately the challenge author was feeling nice as it turned out that was already the correct json. How do we know this? We can easily confirm this since this gives us a known decrypted-encrypted pair of blocks, which we can use to construct a small block. In particular, we construct `{             }` with 13 spaces in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can we leak from the binary? Basically, a valid json returns a 200 and an invalid json returns a 400. Oh, also it doesn't unpad correctly, which helps greatly. It only looks at the last byte and then takes away that many bytes from the array. And it can also be greater than 16, which is amazing!\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, let's just write some basic boilerplate stuff, and also double-check that we do in fact know the initial plaintext."

Well, we also can't have a backslash or a quote, so that's 222 valid bytes out of 256.\n",
